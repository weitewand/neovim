# nvim

### Git

I installed lazygit (https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) as a fast and easy way to work with git from the terminal.
ToDo: Get lazygit running from inside nvim and make a shortcut for it.

### Plugins

Saved at '/pack/plugin/' and then 
  * 'start/' for plugins that are loaded when starting nvim
  * 'opt/' for plugins that are loaded manually when needed

Plugins at 'start/'
  * NERDTree
  * NERDTree-git-plugin
  * onedark.vim
  * indent-blankline
  * which-key.nvim
